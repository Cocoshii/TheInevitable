# The Inevitable
The Inevitable is a very simple visual novel that I made in high school for a grade 12 school project using Pygame.
I had only been learning Python for a little under 2 years and by working on this project, I learned how to plan out a game's
plot, mechanics, characters, and other game features in a short period of time, and then finding a way to implement these assets from scratch.

Prior to creating The Inevitable, I had used RPG Maker VX Ace for game development as a hobby, where implementing game features was much more
user-friendly and efficient. I had to exercise critical thinking to discover how to write code for these features, as well as set realistic boundaries
for the project and myself so that it was possible to write functional code in a few weeks. The result was a relatively short, but complete storyline
with three different endings, visuals which I set up using RPG Maker MV, and background music which I composed.

Looking back on the code, there are definitely a lot of inefficiencies and better ways to construct the algorithms. The storyline and dialogue could
also be improved, although it is important not to be a perfectionist when you have a time limit and limited capabilities. The focus here was to
exercise my ability to create something from nothing with the current knowledge and time that I had.

Given I only had under 2 years of experience with actual programming, I view this project as the first project where I put to the test, everything
I learned in my computer science classes. I hope to eventually develop fully-fledged programs or games as I continue to learn about programming.
